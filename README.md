VolunteerBridge is a full-stack AI platform that intelligently matches verified volunteers to disaster relief and community crisis situations in real time. The moment an NGO admin reports a crisis, the system scores every available volunteer across skills, GPS proximity, trust score, and urgency — and surfaces the best matches in seconds.

## The Problem

When disasters strike, every minute matters. Yet most NGOs still coordinate volunteers through phone calls, spreadsheets, and WhatsApp groups. This chaotic process leads to the wrong people being sent to the wrong places, or nobody being sent at all — costing lives.

In India alone, there are over 3 million NGOs operating across hundreds of districts. None of them have a standardised, real-time volunteer dispatch system.

## Our Solution

VolunteerBridge replaces manual coordination with AI-driven dispatch. When a crisis is reported:

1. The **Smart Match engine** (a PostGIS SQL function) runs a weighted scoring algorithm across every verified, available volunteer within a dynamic radius.
2. The **top-matched volunteers** are surfaced to the admin instantly — with their skill match, distance, trust score, and match percentage visualised.
3. The **assigned volunteer** gets a real-time push notification and can accept, start, and complete the task from their dashboard.
4. On completion, they submit a **proof of work** text report, and their **Trust Score** is automatically recalculated.
5. The admin can then **rate** the volunteer, closing the accountability loop.

This compresses what used to take hours of phone coordination into a few seconds of AI-assisted decision-making.

|---|---|
| 🔐 Role-based Auth | Separate flows for Volunteers and NGO Admins via Supabase Auth |
| 🗺️ Live Crisis Map | Real-time issue pins on a dark-mode Leaflet map with urgency icons, volunteer markers, and radius overlay |
| 🤖 Smart Match Engine | PostGIS `smart_match_volunteers()` SQL function scores by skill (35%), proximity (30%), trust (25%), availability (10%) |
| ✅ Volunteer Verification | Document upload (Supabase Storage) + phone OTP flow + admin approval panel |
| 📋 Task Lifecycle | Full accept → start → proof submission → resolved pipeline with Supabase Realtime sync |
| ⭐ Trust Score System | Auto-recalculated via `recalculate_trust_score()` RPC after each task completion |
| 🔔 Real-time Notifications | Supabase Realtime pushes task assignments, approvals, and resolution alerts |
| ✨ Gemini AI Integration | Issue description enhancement via Gemini 2.0 Flash + Gemini-powered in-app chatbot assistant |
| 📊 Admin Console | Issues table, volunteer roster, approval queue, and smart match panel in one dashboard |
| 🏅 Rating System | Admins rate volunteers post-task; ratings feed directly into trust score recalculation |

## How the AI Matching Works

When an NGO admin assigns a volunteer to a crisis issue, the backend runs a PostGIS-powered scoring function:

```sql
match_score =
  (skill_overlap_bonus)           -- 35 pts if volunteer skills match issue category
  + (proximity_score)             -- up to 30 pts based on GPS distance vs dynamic radius
  + (trust_score / 100.0 * 25)   -- up to 25 pts from historical reputation
  + (availability_bonus)          -- 10 pts if volunteer is marked available
```

The dynamic radius scales with urgency: `critical` = 200 km, `high` = 100 km, `medium` = 75 km, `low` = 50 km.

This ensures the most qualified, closest, and most reliable volunteers are always dispatched first.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project with the **PostGIS** extension enabled
- A [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) API key for Gemini

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VolunteerBridge.git
cd VolunteerBridge
```

### 2. Set up the Supabase database

Open your Supabase project → SQL Editor → New Query, then run these scripts in order:

```
1. supabase_FULL_SETUP.sql       ← tables, RLS, PostGIS functions
2. seed_volunteers_with_auth.sql ← optional demo data
```

Also create a private **Storage bucket** named `volunteer-docs` for ID document uploads.

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside `frontend/`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
```

> ⚠️ Never commit this file. It is already in `.gitignore`.

### 4. Install and run

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Database Schema (Key Tables)

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `volunteer_profiles` | Skills, GPS location, trust score, verification status |
| `ngo_profiles` | NGO name, city, admin user mapping |
| `issues` | Crisis reports with PostGIS `GEOGRAPHY(POINT)` location |
| `task_assignments` | Volunteer↔issue assignments with full lifecycle status |
| `ratings` | Admin ratings per assignment, feeds trust score |
| `notifications` | Real-time notification queue per user |
| `otp_verifications` | Phone OTP records with expiry |

Key PostgreSQL functions:
- `smart_match_volunteers(p_issue_id, p_limit)` — returns ranked volunteer matches
- `recalculate_trust_score(p_volunteer_id)` — recomputes score from ratings + completion history
- `volunteers_near(lat, lng, radius_km)` — proximity search using PostGIS ST_DWithin
